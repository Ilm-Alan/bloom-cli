# What's New in Bloom 0.1.2

- **Clean launches** — No more phantom update warnings. Bloom now checks for updates against the right package, so your terminal stays quiet unless there's actually something new.

- **Bloom is its own thing now** — Fully decoupled from the upstream fork. Version checks, auto-updates, and changelogs all point home.
